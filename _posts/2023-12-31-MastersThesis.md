title: My Masters Thesis
---

After a tedious one and a half years, I was finally able to publish my Masters Thesis. My project was on Bipedal Locomotion on Granular Terrain and the learning curve and mindset tuning for conducting academic professional research was one of the most important skills I attained during this brief period.

Focuses:

1. Analyzing Foot Terrain Interaction with Granular Media

The complexities in the interaction between feet and granular terrain invoke many uncertainties especially when corresponding to stability and balance. Multiple force equations govern this phenomena and the unevenness of terrain subconsiously alters our gait, or mannerism of walking.

2. Human Locomotion and Leg Dynamics with Granular Media


3. Robot Locomotion, Control, and System Identification
