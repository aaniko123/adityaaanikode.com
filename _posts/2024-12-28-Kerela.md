1. Palakkad

    - Kalpathy Village

    - Anikode Village
        Referred to as our Kaave, the temple which is directly related to our ancestry, my family worships Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswathi.

    - Tharakad Village

2. Munnar

    - Tea Village

The vastness of greenery mesmerized me as we drove through the tea scaped mountains of Munnar. Our route sent us straight through a tiger wildlife reserve, as we gripped onto our seats navigating through mountains with roads only large enough for one car to pass through at a time.

3. Cochin

    Fort Kochi

In my recent travels to God's Own Country, Kerela opened my eyes to how the natural world should be. From all kinds of horniculture, biodiversity, and verdure, the interactions and respect between human and nature coexistance appealed very much to my eyes.
