1. Palakkad

    - Kapathy Village

    - Anikode Village
        Referred to as our Kaave, the temple which is directly related to our ancestry, my family worships Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswathi.

    - Tharakad Village

2. Munnar

    - Tea Village

The vastness of greenery mesmerized me as we drove through the tea scaped mountains of Munnar. Our route sent us straight through a tiger wildlife reserve, as we gripped onto our seats navigating through mountains with roads only large enough for one car to pass through at a time.

3. Cochin

    Fort Kochi
