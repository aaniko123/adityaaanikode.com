**Building a hobby rocket:**

This is a general tutorial on how to build your own rocket. Note that this tutorial serves as a basic guide to designigng and fabricating your rocket, however many nuances reside, such as the altitude you wish to attain, what motor you want to use, if a payload is needed, and which sensor modules you want to implement (ALTIMETER and GPS are most likely necessary to be implemented).

**Software used:**

- SOLIDWORKS or any CAD modeling software
- OPENROCKET for simulating rocket's center of pressure, center of gravity, and finding the thrust curve
